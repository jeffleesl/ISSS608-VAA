Setting the Scene\n\nTourism is one of Thailand’s largest industries, accounting for some 20% of the gross domestic product (GDP). In 2019, Thailand earned 90 billion US\\$ from domestic and international tourism, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused revenues to crash to 24 billion US\\$ in 2020.\n\nFigure below shows the total revenue receipt from tourism sector from January 2019 until Feb 2023. The figure reveals that the revenue from tourism industry have been recovered gradually since September 2021.\n\n![](images/clipboard-378385426.png)\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the tourism economy of Thailand are not evenly distributed. Figure below reveals that the tourism economy of Thailand are mainly focus on five provinces, namely Bangkok, Phuket, Chiang Mai, Sukhothai and Phetchaburi.\n\n![](images/clipboard-986836251.png)\n\n# 2. Objectives\n\nAs a a curious geospatial analytics green horn, we are interested to discover:\n\n-   if the key indicators of tourism economy of Thailand are independent from space and space and time.\n\n-   If the tourism economy is indeed spatial and spatio-temporal dependent, then, you would like to detect where are the clusters and outliers, and the emerging hot spot/cold spot areas.\n\n# 3. The Task\n\nThe specific tasks of this take-home exercise are as follows:\n\nUsing appropriate function of sf and tidyverse, preparing the following geospatial data layer: a study area layer in sf polygon features. It must be at province level (including Bangkok) of Thailand. a tourism economy indicators layer within the study area in sf polygon features. a derived tourism economy indicator layer in spacetime s3 class of sfdep. Keep the time series at month and year levels. Using the extracted data, perform global spatial autocorrelation analysis by using sfdep methods. Using the extracted data, perform local spatial autocorrelation analysis by using sfdep methods. Using the extracted data, perform emerging hotspot analysis by using sfdep methods. Describe the spatial patterns revealed by the analysis above.\n\n# 4. The Data\n\nFor the purpose of this take-home exercise, two data sets shall be used, they are:\n\nThailand Domestic Tourism Statistics at Kaggle. You are required to use version 2 of the data set.\n\nThailand - Subnational Administrative Boundaries at HDX. You are required to use the province boundary data set.\n\n# 5. Importing Packages\n\nBefore we start the exercise, we will need to import necessary R packages first. We will use the following packages:\n\n-   [spNetwork](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spNetwork/index.html), which provides functions to perform Spatial Point Patterns Analysis such as kernel density estimation (KDE) and K-function on network. It also can be used to build spatial matrices (‘listw’ objects like in ‘spdep’ package) to conduct any kind of traditional spatial analysis with spatial weights based on reticular distances.\n\n-   [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html) package provides functions to manage, processing, and manipulate **Simple Features**, a formal geospatial data standard that specifies a storage and access model of spatial geometries such as points, lines, and polygons.\n\n-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.\n\n-   [**ggplot2**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/) which provide functions for creating advanced visualizations, graphics and maps using the Grammar of Graphics.\n\n-   [**knitr**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/) which provide functions for dynamic report generation in R using Literate Programming techniques.\n\n-   [**sfdep**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sfdep/index.html) which provide functions for utilizes list columns extensively to make this interface possible.\n\n-   [**smoothr**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/smoothr/index.html) which provide functions for smoothing and tidying spatial features (i.e. lines and polygons) to make them more aesthetically pleasing.\n\n-   [**lubridate**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html) which provide functions to work with date-times and time-spans: fast and user friendly parsing of date-time data, extraction and updating of components of a date-time (years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds), algebraic manipulation on date-time and time-span objects.\n\n-   [**leaflet**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet/index.html) which provide functions for create and customize interactive maps.\n\n-   Use the code chunk below to install and launch the below R packages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, tmap, knitr, ggplot2, smoothr, lubridate, sfdep, leaflet, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 6. Getting the Data Into R Environment\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to bring a geospatial data and its associated attribute table into R environment. The geospatial data is in ESRI shapefile format and the attribute table is in csv fomat.\n\n## 6.1 Import shapefile into r environment\n\n### 6.1.1 Thailand Domestic Tourism Statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthaadm1 <- st_read(dsn = \"data/rawdata\", \n                layer = \"tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121\") %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 32647)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\user\\OneDrive - Singapore Management University\\MITB\\6.
