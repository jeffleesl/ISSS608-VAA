Overview\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will gain hands-on experience on how to delineate homogeneous region by using geographically referenced multivariate data. There are two major analysis, namely:\n\n-   hierarchical cluster analysis; and\n\n-   spatially constrained cluster analysis.\n\n## 1.1 Learning Outcome\n\nWe will able:\n\n-   to convert GIS polygon data into R’s simple feature data.frame by using appropriate functions of **sf** package of R;\n\n-   to convert simple feature data.frame into R’s SpatialPolygonDataFrame object by using appropriate **sf** of package of R;\n\n-   to perform custer analysis by using *hclust()* of Base R;\n\n-   to perform spatially constrained cluster analysis using *skater()* of Base R; and\n\n-   to visualise the analysis output by using **ggplot2** and **tmap** package.\n\n# 2. Getting Started\n\n## 2.1 The analytical question\n\nIn geobusiness and spatial policy, it is a common practice to delineate the market or planning area into homogeneous regions by using multivariate data. In this hands-on exercise, we are interested to delineate [Shan State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_State), [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar) into homogeneous regions by using multiple Information and Communication technology (ICT) measures, namely: Radio, Television, Land line phone, Mobile phone, Computer, and Internet at home.\n\n# 3. The data\n\nTwo data sets will be used in this study. They are:\n\n-   Myanmar Township Boundary Data (i.e. *myanmar_township_boundaries*) : This is a GIS data in ESRI shapefile format. It consists of township boundary information of Myanmar. The spatial data are captured in polygon features.\n\n-   *Shan-ICT.csv*: This is an extract of [**The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Myanmar**](https://myanmar.unfpa.org/en/publications/2014-population-and-housing-census-myanmar-data-sheet) at the township level.\n\nBoth data sets are download from [Myanmar Information Management Unit (MIMU)](http://themimu.info/)\n\n# 3.1 Installing and loading R packages\n\nBefore we get started, it is important for us to install the necessary R packages into R and launch these R packages into R environment.\n\nThe R packages needed for this exercise are as follows:\n\n-   Spatial data handling\n\n    -   **sf**, **rgdal** and **spdep**\n\n-   Attribute data handling\n\n    -   **tidyverse**, especially **readr**, **ggplot2** and **dplyr**\n\n-   Choropleth mapping\n\n    -   **tmap**\n\n-   Multivariate data visualisation and analysis\n\n    -   **coorplot**, **ggpubr**, and **heatmaply**\n\n-   Cluster analysis\n\n    -   **cluster**\n\n    -   **ClustGeo**\n\nThe code chunks below installs and launches these R packages into R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(spdep, tmap, sf, ClustGeo, \n               ggpubr, cluster, factoextra, NbClust,\n               heatmaply, corrplot, psych, tidyverse, GGally)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npackage 'ClustGeo' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpUv1hLB\\downloaded_packages\npackage 'corrplot' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'ggsci' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'gridExtra' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'polynom' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'rstatix' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'ggpubr' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpUv1hLB\\downloaded_packages\npackage 'estimability' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'viridis' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'DT' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'ellipse' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'emmeans' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'flashClust' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'leaps' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'scatterplot3d' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'dendextend' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'FactoMineR' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'factoextra' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpUv1hLB\\downloaded_packages\npackage 'NbClust' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpUv1hLB\\downloaded_packages\npackage 'permute' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'ca' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'gclus' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'qap' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'registry' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'TSP' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'vegan' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'seriation' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'webshot' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'assertthat' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'egg' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'heatmaply' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpUv1hLB\\downloaded_packages\npackage 'mnormt' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'GPArotation' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'psych' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpUv1hLB\\downloaded_packages\npackage 'ggstats' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'GGally' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpUv1hLB\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nWith tidyverse, we do not have to install readr, ggplot2 and dplyr packages separately. In fact, tidyverse also installs other very useful R packages such as tidyr.\n:::\n\n# 4. Data Import and Prepatation\n\n## 4.1 Importing geospatial data into R environment\n",
